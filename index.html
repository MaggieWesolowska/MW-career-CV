            I was always passionate about web development and recently I have finally succeeded in re-directing my career that way. Having a background in project management and development I’m experienced in handling technical challenges to find solutions to problems, as well as applying any documentation to assist with issue solving. Having been in charge of team of employees I have been training and supporting my team as well as dealing with all types of customer related enquires, keeping up with deadlines and working under pressure. In daily approach I’m organised, resourceful and persistent.
